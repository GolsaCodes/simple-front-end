# simple-front-end
This project is the front end of a fan website for football club Barcelona in Persian using HTML , CSS and Java Script. This is just a simple example of usage of HTML &amp; CSS for beginners and I worked on this when I fisrt started learning front-end development. I used CSS Flexbox layout and also made sure that it works as a responsive web page.
